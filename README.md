# BW to color
This project is a part of Data Science hobby projects of mine.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to use machine learning and computer vision techniques to convert the Black and White Videos to color. Thanks for Deoldify model created by Jason Antic. DeOldify is based on the fast.ai library â€” which brings more power and optimization for deep learning developers.DeOldify is using Generative Adversarial Networks with the iterative interplay between two Neural Networks Generator and Discriminator.


### Methods Used
* Machine Learning
* Video GAN
* Deoldify


### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter



## Project Description
I have fed short videos of old black and white from youtube and Imgur to run the model and generate the colored version of the videos. Some of the results can be found below





## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is extracted from wikipedia page [here]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motorcycle_manufacturers)
3. Wikipedia page extration file is kept [here](https://github.com/tejeshb/Near_RealTime_NLP_On_Bike_Craze_By_Location/blob/master/wiki.py)
4. Location extraction / near by location search is done [here](https://github.com/tejeshb/Near_RealTime_NLP_On_Bike_Craze_By_Location/blob/master/loc.py)
5. Twitter API script to call, search, preprocess, clean and Visulaize can be found [here](https://github.com/tejeshb/Near_RealTime_NLP_On_Bike_Craze_By_Location/blob/master/twitter.py)
